# HWTracker
A vanilla JS homework tracker with an Express server using MongoDB

The objective of this app is to create a common inferface for parents and children to keep track of what the students homework assignments are and what has been completed.

It provides an incentive for completion by way of a point system.
Points can be redeemed for items added to a wish list.
