Steps:


Create an empty file in your favorite spreadsheet program

Login to TEAMS and click on your students Report Cards tab
Using your totally bad ass ninja copy/paste skills
	- underneath where it says"scheduled"
	- use your mouse to select the table data from the top left to the bottom right, not including the columns with the grades. We'll get to that later
	- got it? Make sure you didn't leave out the verrry first digit of the course number in the first cell. It's easy to miss.
	- got it? Are you sure? If there's a scrollbar on the right side of the window there might be some rows hidden. You might need click and scroll at the same time to get it all.
	- copy that using CTRL-C
	- paste it into your empty spreadsheet
	- copy the column headers and paste them in about the other data
	- save that as a csv named "courses_FA20" or something like that

for each course click on the red numbers to see the assignments for that grading period
for each table select the table data like you did before and CTRL-C copy and paste into an assignments file
